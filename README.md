# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of analysis: The purpose of this analysis.

PyBer, a python based ridesharing app company has asked for an exploratory analysis on some of their ride data.
We will be looking at the type of city, number of drivers and riders in addition to the percentage of fares, rides and drivers by types of cities. The types for this analysis will be broken up into URBAN, SUBURBAN and RURAL. 

## Resources:

-Data Souce:  PyBer_ride_data.csv
              city_data.csv
              ride_data.csv 

Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

## Results 
### The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

The results of this analysis were clear. Looking at 2375 unique rides, urban cities had the most rides and the most drivers, followed by Suburban cities and lastly rural areas.

## Summary:

Looking at the data it is clear that ridesharing apps are most utilized in urban areas and that is currently where PyBer is making the most money regardless of the higher prices in rural and suburban areas. Further analysis could be done to determine what role lack of drivers and higher fares plays in fewer rides or if it is simply a services that is not as requested due to other factors.  To determine if additional drivers are needed in a given area, PyBer could compile data on average wait time of riders and cancellations.

Additional analysis could be done to look at a larger timeperiod, demographics of riders, average length of rides and popularity and avability of other transportation services in the cities that we are looking at.
